# Roger's Math Whiteboard

Roger's Math Whiteboard LITE is a simple web App written in pure HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS; which is intended to suit the specific needs of math teachers. It is intended to be used while presenting course material on a touchscreen or similar device. In its current form, it is best described as a multi-page image editor with some additional features that suit the needs of the intended audience. It is intended as a preview of the main desktop app named Roger's Math Whiteboard. The LITE version is essentially a carbon-copy of Roger's Math Whiteboardâ€™s main user interface, with a limited feature set representing things that are simply not possible through the browser.
