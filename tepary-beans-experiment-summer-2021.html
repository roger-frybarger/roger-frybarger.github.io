  <h1>Roger's Tepary Bean Experiment of 2021</h1>
  
  <p>Hello internetz, apparently a bunch of you are curious about how I managed to grow a bunch of beans in the hot sonoran desert summer without any soil amendments, fertilizer, or daily wattering. Below I will attempt to briefly explain how I accomplished this feat so that perhaps you can do the same:</p>
  
  <br>
  <p>So, this whole adventure started early in the summer of 2021 as a quest to obtain shade for the west wall of our house. I was doing research on the internet about what kinds of climbing/vining plants would be able to survive our intense summers. I did find several options in that regard, but none that really perked my interest. I was also hesatant to regularly water something for the sole purpose of obtaining shade. Eventually after persisting at this search for quite some time, I stumbled upon Tepary beans as an option. These really facinated me as I had always wondered how the native peoples of this area had survived in such a harsh environment for thousands of years. Researching Tepary beans helped answer those questions, and inspire me to try growing them for myself.</p>
  
  <p>Ultimately I decided to try out Tepary beans as an experiment first, and evaluate their feasibility as temporary shade plants for the west wall. I started by purchasing seeds for <a href="https://www.nativeseeds.org/collections/tepary-beans/products/pt077" target="_blank">Yellow Tepary from nativeseeds.org</a>. Once they arrived, I planted 11 of them in a rabbit-protected area arround July 10th 2021. Shortly thereafter I added a 5.5 foot (168 cm) tall trelis for them to climb up. I planted each seed about an inch deep, which I felt was about right given how quickly our soil dried out. I also ensured there was a pronounced water basin arround the entire planting area to hold the water by the seeds. I chose a planting area that recieved some afternoon shade as I was suspicious of the calimed heat tollerance on the seed packet. However, I would feel comfortable planting these in full sun next time. Initially, I watered these seeds every evening so that they would sprout. However, after that initial sprouting period, I transitioned to watering roughly every 4 days unless it rained. I did not add any organic mater, mulch, fertilizer, or poting soil before planting as I wanted to determine whether our native soil was fit for growing these beans.</p>
  
  <p>As the experiment progressed I learned many things. The trelis did prove useful and by August 1st they had already climbed about 2.5 feet (76 cm) up it. Unfortunetly, I was also starting to have disease problems at this point and had to remove several leaves to controll some type of white fungi. After researching the issue I decided to switch to botom watering to avoid spreading the disease any further. Keeping the plant leaves dry definetly helped and allowed the experiment to continue. In hindsight, I also should have planted the seeds further apart. I didn't know how big the plants would get, and planted them about 2 inched apart. This was too close together. I should have planted them about 5 or 6 inches apart for beter airflow between the plants. This would have helped reduce the spread as well.</p>
  
  <p>By August 25th the monsoon season was in full swing and we had already recieved almost 10 inches of rain. This was great as I was able to get by without watering for weeks at times. Unfortunetly it also brought in every plant pest one could possibly imagine. This amount of summer rainfal is somewhat unusual for this area, and as such, the plants that are adapted to this area don't typically need to handle the abount of pest preasure that we recieved this summer. This meant that these tepary beans were not fully prepared to handle the abundance of bugs. Most of the bugs were however repeled by the natural defences of the tepary beans. The one bug that did manage to get past these defences was the lace bug, which proceeded to suck the plant juces, bring in more diseases, and multiply quickly. To combat this unwelcome invador I researched Garlic spray on the internet and experemented with various mixtures. At first I used an overly concentrated mixture of dish soap and garlic concentrate, which suceeded in repelling the bugs, but also burned the bean leaves. Eventually I found an effective spray recipe that did not burn the leaves, but I wish I had done this research before I needed the spray. While I was fiddling about with the various garlic spray experiments the bugs did a fair amount of damage to the plants.</p>
  
  <p>In all, this experiment has produced over 127 grams of beans from those 11 seeds, which I am positively thrilled about! I will definitely be growing more of these next summer and I hope that you will be as well!</p>
