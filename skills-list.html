  <h1 style="text-align:center;">Roger's Skills List</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center;">Welcome! Thank you for taking the time to review my skills list! Please select the section below that you are interested in viewing:</p>


  <input type="checkbox"  id="spoiler1" /> 
  <label for="spoiler1" >Roger the Technologist</label>
  <div class="spoiler">
    First off, I aspire to be a technological generalist to the extent possible and in pursuit of that goal, I have earned a bachelors degree in technology management:
    <br>
    <figure>
      <img src="skills-list-imgs/nau-degree.jpeg" alt="NAU Degree" style="width:100%">
    </figure>
    <br>
    In addition to these academic pursuits, I have also been involved in several various extracurricular activities as follows:
    <br><br>
    1. I have created and published a desktop program that aims to make it easier for math and science teachers to use touchscreen/pen devices for delivering their instruction. You can find more about it <a href="http://rogersmathwhiteboard.com/">here</a>.
    <br><br>
    2. Being an avid Linux user myself I chose to give back to my local community at the time by setting up a Linux lab for my fellow Community College students to use. This volunteer work eventually made it into the local paper as part of a broader college remodel story which you can read about <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cvk7KTwOCAP82wgLCfoCfrlgrbnurncD/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
    <br><br>
    On a more practical level, I have used my technology skills to create solutions to some everyday problems that I have encountered. Here are a few such solutions:
    <br><br>
    1. I have created an online calculator for converting lines from one form to y=mx+b. It can be found <a href="https://codebyrfrybarger.com/lines-program.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
    <br><br>
    2. I have created an online calculator for exploring and sizing rainwater collection systems. It can be found <a href="https://codebyrfrybarger.com/rain-harvesting-calculator.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
    <br><br>
    3. I have created a program to smoothly reduce the hotend temperature while 3d printing. I use it to increase bed adhesion while still avoiding printing the rest of the part too hot. This program can be found <a href="https://codebyrfrybarger.com/gcode-temp-reducer.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
    <br><br>
    4. I have used computer code and an arduino to pulse the fan in my air conditioner to make it quieter.
    <br><br>
    5. I have edited the computer code that operates my 3d printer to add relevant menu options.
    <br><br>
    6. I have used a spare Raspberry Pi computer to create a white noise generator so that I can sleep better at night.
    <br><br>
    7. I have used Google Apps Script to create the infrastructure necessary for students to schedule online tutoring appointments with me.
    <br><br>
    8. I have used Google Apps Script to set up an automated bot that prepares a daily email for me containing the weather, and some relevant discussions that I might be interested in from various forums.
    <br><br>
    9. I have created a networking setup for my parents and I that securely separates the relevant networks form each other while also accommodating guest access, a local server, and smart devices. Here is a picture of this setup:
    <br>
    <figure>
      <img src="skills-list-imgs/networking-setup.jpg" alt="Networking setup" style="width:100%">
    </figure>
    <br><br>
    While creating all of the above projects I became familiar with a large variety of tools, frameworks, and programming languages. Here are some such things that I have become somewhat familiar with:
    <br><br>
    Programming languages: Javascript, HTML, CSS, Java, C++ Python, Bash, Google Apps Script, C#, Visual Basic, Ruby.
    <br><br>
    Frameworks and platforms: Electron, .net, Qt, Google Workspace, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Linux, Windows.
    <br><br>
    Tools: Git and Github, Geany, Chrome Developer Tools, Arduino IDE, LibreOffice, MS Office.

  <label for="spoiler2">Roger the Tutor</label>
  <div class="spoiler">
    I have earned a bachelors degree in technology management:
    <br>

      <img src="skills-list-imgs/nau-degree.jpeg" alt="NAU Degree" style="width:100%">
    </figure>
    <br>
    I also have an extensive history of working as a tutor helping students with Math and Computer programming dating back to 2011. Much of this tutoring was done at Mohave Community College where I worked part time while going to school. I also earned some tutoring certifications which can be viewed <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EDMxCZNP1Vpkf9hFAxpboPGpTDWetqSJ" target="_blank">here</a>.
    <br><br>
    During my time as a tutor at Mohave Community College, I received this orchid in the local paper:
    <br>

    </figure>
    <br><br>
    To supplement this tutoring activity I built an online tutoring system and a whiteboard program from the ground up. You can check these two things out <a href="https://www.tutoringbyroger.com" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://rogersmathwhiteboard.com/" target="_blank">here</a> respectively.

  <label for="spoiler3">Roger the Builder</label>
  <div class="spoiler">
    I started experimenting with building things very young. Here I am building a shelf at age 5:
    <br>

    </figure>
    <br><br>
    I was then tutored by a mechanical engineer when I was roughly 11:

    </figure>
    <br><br>
    I then helped build our house in Lake Havasu City from an empty lot onward. Here is a picture of the lot before the house followed by one with the house:
    <br>
    <figure>
      <img src="skills-list-imgs/empty-lot.jpg" alt="Image of empty lot before house." style="width:100%">

    <figure>
      <img src="skills-list-imgs/Finished-House.jpeg" alt="Image of house Roger helped build in Lake Havasu City." style="width:100%">
    </figure>
    <br><br>
    During our time in Havasu I worked on many of my dad's rental properties doing various repairs. These repairs included doing roofing, tile, plumbing, electrical, and cleaning among other things.
    <br><br>
    I have also dabbled with off-grid solar systems. Here are some of my experiments:
    <br>

      <img src="skills-list-imgs/Solar-Stuff.jpg" alt="Images of Roger’s solar experiments." style="width:100%">
    </figure>
    <br><br>
    I have also restored a 3d printer and learned to use CAD to create and print objects:

      <img src="skills-list-imgs/3d-printer-and-cad.jpg" alt="Some pictures of Roger’s 3d printer and CAD work." style="width:100%">
    </figure>
    <br><br>
    Here are several other representative things that I have built: First off, the redwood coffee table I built at age 13:
    <br>

    </figure>
    <br><br>
    Here is the lapidary equipment that I built when I was roughly 15:

      <img src="skills-list-imgs/Camper.jpg" alt="Some pictures of Roger’s camper." style="width:100%">
    </figure>
    <br><br>
    And finally, here is the desk that I built for my new room here in Mesa:
    <br>
    <figure>
      <img src="skills-list-imgs/Desk.jpg" alt="Two pictures of Roger’s desk." style="width:100%">
    </figure>
    <br><br>
    Thus, to summarize, I have had lots of experience building many various things at many points throughout my life.

  <input type="checkbox"  id="spoiler4" /> 
  <label for="spoiler4">Roger the Gardener</label>
  <div class="spoiler">
    I was born to parents who loved gardening:
    <br>
    <figure>
      <img src="skills-list-imgs/gardening-with-parents.jpg" alt="Roger gardening with parents." style="width:100%">
    </figure>
    <br><br>
    Unsurprisingly, I also started gardening at a young age:
    <br>
    <figure>
      <img src="skills-list-imgs/first-gardens.jpg" alt="Roger’s first gardens." style="width:100%">
    </figure>
    <br><br>
    After we moved to Lake Havasu City, I completed the Arizona Master Watershed Stewart Program:
    <br>
    <figure>
      <img src="skills-list-imgs/master-watershed-stewart-program.jpg" alt="Roger’s Master Watershed Stewart Program Certificate of Completion." style="width:100%">
    </figure>
    <br><br>
    I also grew many successful gardens in Havasu despite the extreme climate:
    <br>

      <img src="skills-list-imgs/havasu-gardens2.jpg" alt="Havasu Garden pictures part 2." style="width:100%">
    </figure>
    <br><br>
    Now that we are in Mesa, I still continue to garden:
    <br>

  <input type="checkbox"  id="spoiler5" /> 
  <label for="spoiler5">Roger the Archivist</label>
  <div class="spoiler">
    I helped my mother digitize over 15,000 photographs over about 4 years worth of our combined free time. The source material consisted of both slides and printed pictures. We used a slide projector and a digital camera for the slides, and captured the prints with the system shown below:
    <br>

      <img src="skills-list-imgs/picture-digitization-process2.jpg" alt="More images showing Roger’s picture digitization device and the stack of digitized prints." style="width:100%">
    </figure>
    <br><br>
    There were also several dozen tapes with family videos that I helped digitize. My programming skills came in very handy to process all of the digitized material.
    <br><br>
    Once all of this digitization was completed I organized the entire collection into a format that would be easy to view on various devices.
